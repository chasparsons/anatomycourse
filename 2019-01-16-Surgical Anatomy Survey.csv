What exactly is the educational goal? Is the goal really to learn breast anatomy on a cadaver? If you are teaching pgy3 residents breast anatomy with this course, the program overall should probably reevaluate its teaching methods. 

I think that the course benefits residents by taking a few critical procedures/operative cases that we may never see (many of us may never see an ED thoracotomy, do a forearm fasiotomy, or do a cesarean section in residency) and relating them to skills we may already have/know to help us remember how to do them in high pressure situations.

I think the course was a bit too much like my med school course - generic anatomy. That's not really level appropriate.

I fully agree with the response that we should have taken more ownership of the course and should have prepared more and prepared better. ",""
